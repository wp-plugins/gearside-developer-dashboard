Add metaboxes on your WordPress Admin Dashboard for developer info and TODO Manager

== Description ==

This plugin allows developers to have at a glance information directly on the WordPress Admin Dashboard. From basics like domain and server IP to more advanced like registrar, expiration date, and page speed timing. Additionally, a second metabox is available which finds TODO comments in the theme and organizes them. It also allows for categorizing and prioritizing TODO tasks.
